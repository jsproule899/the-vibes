# The Vibes

This React Webapp displays my most recently played song on spotify, meaning I can share the my current vibe with anyone with a very handy url [thevibes.fun](https://thevibes.fun)

This was inspired by Chris Laughlin's talk at NIDC 2025 "How It’s (Re)Made: Reverse Engineering Apps Into Your Own Tools", you can find him [here](https://github.com/chrislaughlin)
